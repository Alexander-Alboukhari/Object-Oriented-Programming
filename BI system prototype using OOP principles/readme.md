Introduction:
This project constructs a prototype for the ABC-BI system to demonstrate the advantages of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) design. It serves as a practical model to explain the structure and application of commonly used programming designs and essential OOP concepts.

Key Concepts:

Design Patterns: Implemented established models developed by "The Gang of Four" to support scalable and maintainable software design.
Business Scenario: Focused on building a design that can be readily expanded in the future without heavy modifications.
Highlights:

Developed a comprehensive BI system prototype using OOP principles.
Demonstrated the use of various design patterns to enhance software scalability and maintainability.
Provided a detailed explanation of OOP concepts with practical applications in a BI context.
Skills & Tools:

-Object Oriented Programming
-Design Patterns
-Python Programming
-Business Intelligence System Design

Practical Applications:
This project showcases the use of OOP and design patterns in developing scalable and maintainable BI systems. It provides a blueprint for future expansions and modifications, making it a valuable reference for software developers and data scientists working on similar projects.
